This is the Code Directory.
 All of my (N02734910) code will go here, unless otherwise noted.
 This directory contains the following programs:
 
 -blink.py which makes an LED blink three times with a second pause between blink.
 
 -logTemperature.py which reads the temperature and sents the output to a database using sqlite3.
